# About

This is a time management app, this will tell you how long to work for and when to stop working.

This is supported on Linux and MacOS.

## Setup
```commandline
python setup.py
```
Answer all the questions it asks in that file. It also moves files that run whenToWork

#
```commandline
python main.py
```

That runs whenToWork

In the future double click on ``whenToWork.sh``, it should run everything when you click on it.
